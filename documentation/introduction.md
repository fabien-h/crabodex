Crabodex is a versatile and efficient documentation generator. It scans your project directory, processes Markdown files, and generates a one-page HTML documentation.

The end goal is to have a centralised document with all the business rules that exist in your repository. It is aimed as much at developers as it is at business analysts, product owners, and other stakeholders. They can know everything that has been implemented and how it works without having to read the code.

It tackles the main problem of documentations : keeping them up to date. With crabodex, you are able to colocate code and documentation. Each documentation file seats next to the code it describes. You can easily check at PR time that the documentation is updated when you change the code.
